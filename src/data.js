        description: "Akihabara is a buzzing shopping hub famed for its electronics retailers, ranging from tiny stalls to vast department stores like Yodobashi Multimedia Akiba. Venues specializing in manga, anime, and video games include Tokyo Anime Center, for exhibits and souvenirs, and Radio Kaikan with 10 floors of toys, trading cards, and collectibles. Staff dressed as maids or butlers serve tea and desserts at nearby maid cafes. I am fascinated by Japanese media and culture, so this is definitely one of the places I am most interested in visiting someday.",

        description: "The Brooklyn Bridge, constructed between 1870 and 1883, is perhaps the most storied and most famous bridge in the world. With a main span of 1,595.5 feet, it was the longest suspension bridge in the world from its opening until 1903, and the first steel-wire suspension bridge ever built. It is special in a different way to me, however, as I wish to travel to New York, to this bridge, to pay respects to a man I and many used to look up to. His name was Desmond Amofah.",

        description: "Austin is the state capital of Texas, an inland city bordering the Hill Country region. Home to the University of Texas flagship campus, Austin is known for its eclectic live-music scene centered around country, blues and rock. Its many parks and lakes are popular for hiking, biking, swimming and boating. South of the city, Formula One's Circuit of the Americas raceway has hosted the United States Grand Prix. The most interesting thing to me about Austin, however, is its massive tech culture. I want to go to meetups for software developers and network so I can involve myself more with the community.",
